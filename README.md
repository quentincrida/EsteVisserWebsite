# EsteVisserWebsite
Beginnings of a website for a musician
Using HTML 5 and CSS, and tiny bit of JS and forspree.io for the email form.
VS Code Users:
Open in VS Code, be sure to have Live Server installed.
Click on the "Go Live" icon bottom right of the VS Code screen to launch the site on Port 5500.
Atom users:
Make sure you have Atom-live-server installed and this will allow you to view the pages of the site.



If you are not using VS Code or Atom, just go to your browser and open a new window. Click 'ctrl + o' and select the correct file (index.html) to open in the browser -  the form won't function fully in this format.
