        <h1>Pianist and Accompanist</h1>
        <p>As a pianist, I have a wealth of experience as a performer in recitals with other instrumentalists and singers, as well as larger chamber music works. From 2010 - 2015 I was the vocal coach and repetiteur for <a href="https://capetownopera.co.za/" target="_blank">Cape Town Opera.</a> <br><br>In Scotland I have worked with <a href="
           https://www.nycos.co.uk/" target="_blank"> National Youth Choir of Scotland (NYCOS)</a> for auditions as well as rehearsals and concerts. Other choirs include the <a href="https://bearsdenchoir.com/" target="_blank">Bearsden Choir</a>, and Paisley Opera. I have also accompanied musicians for ABRSM exams as well as orchestral auditions and recording tracks for Clockwork Sessions. <br><br>Should you need a pianist, feel free to get in touch via my Contact page.</p>
